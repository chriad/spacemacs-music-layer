* Description
This layer installs EMMS and configures it to use MPD. The only dependency of
this layer is a running instance of MPD on your system. You can setup MPD with
the following script:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/mpd
$ cd ~/.config/mpd
$ touch database log pid state sticker sql
#+END_SRC

After that you create the file =~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf= with the following
content (this is an working example if you have pulse audio installed):
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
# Required files
db_file            "~/.config/mpd/database"
log_file           "~/.config/mpd/log"

# Optional
music_directory    "~/Music"
playlist_directory "~/Playlists" # "~/.config/mpd/playlists"
pid_file           "~/.config/mpd/pid"
state_file         "~/.config/mpd/state"
sticker_file       "~/.config/mpd/sticker.sql"

port "12010"

audio_output {
        type            "pulse"
        name            "pulse audio"
}
#+END_SRC

If you want to run MPD as SystemD user level application you can create the file
=~/.config/systemd/user/mpd.service= with the following content:
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
[Unit]
Description=Music Player Daemon (MPD)

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mpd
ExecStop=/usr/bin/mpd --kill
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+END_SRC

Now you can run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ systemctl start --user mpd
$ systemctl enable --user mpd
#+END_SRC

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =music= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

Further you have to give the port of the running MPD instance and connect emacs
to it. You can achieve his by adding the following code to existing
=dotspacemacs/user-config= function in your =~/.spacemacs= file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq emms-player-mpd-server-port "12010") ;; example port
  (emms-player-mpd-connect)
#+END_SRC
